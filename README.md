# Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

**Task List**

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

# Key Learnings of Dashboard Development
  - Explored the use of bookmarks and selection to enhance dashboard functionality, such as implementing page navigation and a clear filter button. 
  - Created a Calendar visual using the matrix table, enabling versatile analytical applications. 
  - Analyzed hotel cancellation policies and found that most hotels allow free cancellation if done at least three months in advance. Cancellations made later typically incur charges between 60% and 90% of the 
    booking cost.  
  - Applied a consistent color palette across the dashboard to maintain visual harmony and a professional look.
